Despite understanding html and css (and worked with it) I quite did not grasp an entire project from ground up. This theme was based on Daktilo and Slim and has some layout minor changes made by me. As plus, this includes tooltip texts, social links and, in my opinion, a better about me experience that fits the theme. Oh, and added git pages plugins

Feel free to use my theme and mostly... since I am still a learner here, feel free to make suggestions and pull requests. It would be nice to learn something from someone who understands web development better than me.


1. clone
2. Install github pages plugins for jekyll
3. jekyll build (or serve)
4. Head to localhost:4000

This is a work in progress.
