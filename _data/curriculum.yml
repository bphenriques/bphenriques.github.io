    I'm a MSc student at Técnico Lisboa working on make robots capable of building rapport!
    I enjoy solving problems (especially AI) and most recently I have found mobile development very intesting. I also have (slight) OCD to refactor code.
    Unless you are here to destroy the world, feel free to contact me. Hope you enjoy my random thoughts.
