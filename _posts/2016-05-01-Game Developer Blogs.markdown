Hello,

I usually like to follow developer blogs as they post interesting stuff such as [this](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-136). It gives a interesting insight on gaming development and it is really great seeing developers sharing this information with the public, at least the nerd-me enjoys these posts :)

Until next time!
