For a long, long time I wanted to publish a decent website. This is quite "it" as there are some quirks as in, I still have to achieve the maximum score (well, except the cookie limitation of github pages) on [PageSpeed Insights][page-speed]. At the moment I am getting 83% on mobile decvices and 88% on computers. I know my profile picture is consuming lots of resources however, when I resize it, it looks just awful.

What I am proud of?
- Learnt there is a thing called Jekyll to generate static web pages more or less easly;
- There lots of cool (hellish) tweaks and benchmarks tool to test our websites;
- Critical Path with CSS, delay CSS/JS loading can make your pages render earlier;
- My about page is stored as a yaml file that is automatically compiled to the neat About page.

What I am not proud of?
- My page rank;
- There is a test related with blog metadata (google test), there is some fields missing like LastDateModified and that;
- Lack of control over cookies. With the cookies I could check if the browser has cached the CSS/JS and avoid one round-trip with all the data (again);
- It's late and I need to know how to make drafts in Jekyll since this post will be reviseted later;

Post in construction for english review.
